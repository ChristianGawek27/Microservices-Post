# Microservices-Post

Microservices is an architecture that provides loosely coupled, strongly encapsulated, scalable and agile development to an application.  This architecture allows a company to take a monolithic application and break it up.  Each component created is independednt and can be scaled up or down depending on the companies needs.  This is critical for companies that recieve large volumes of customers like Netflix, Amazon, Walmart, Google.  When the componets are loosely coupled, upgrades and featurers can be pushed out by each team independently.  In order to implement properly, companies need to have strong agile and dev ops teams, with their programmers having strong architectural skills.  I learned that microservices can be broken into three categories: one is microservices which enables continous delivery, miniservice which improves application agillity, and macroservice to enable functionality within the monolithic application.  Companies that want to implement microservices should be aware that it is a costly undertaking, and can completely change the business nature of a company.  People should be aware that any company hosting an outside API is not using microservices. While it has not gained main stream popularity, it soon will.  To me, microservices seems like a powerful tool that all companies need to have in order to improve flexibillity.
